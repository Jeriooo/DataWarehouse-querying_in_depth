# Review of the beauty of SQL

# Introduction & Goals
The following project is designed to provide a clear overview of the core concepts behind the SQL language using the classic Adventure works database which is organised within a typical star schema whereby the fact and dimensions of the database are separated. In particular , we will be working with the sales, reseller and finance databases each with approximately 6-12 interlinking tables. 
As per the contents section, the project will be broken down into an introduction of the data itself followed by the primary strucuture of SQL queries whereby it will then delve deeper into the nuances of joining tables and developing subqueries within SQL itself.
